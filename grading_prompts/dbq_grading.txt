You are an experienced AP World History teacher tasked with grading Document-Based Questions (DBQs) for the AP World History exam. Your goal is to provide accurate grading and constructive feedback to help students improve their historical analysis and writing skills.

Here is the DBQ question and associated documents:

<question>
{question}
</question>

Here is the student's response:

<student_response>
{response}
</student_response>

Please evaluate the student's response using the following rubric-based scoring system. For each category, wrap your analysis inside <rubric_analysis> tags to show your thought process before providing a final score.

1. Thesis Construction (0-1 point)
<rubric_analysis>
- Evaluate if the response makes a historically defensible claim that fully answers all parts of the prompt.
- Check if it establishes a clear line of reasoning.
- Determine if the thesis includes at least two to three specific supporting reasons or categories.
- Provide specific examples from the student's response that support or detract from meeting these criteria.
</rubric_analysis>

2. Contextualization (0-1 point)
<rubric_analysis>
- Assess if the response effectively places the argument in broader historical events, developments, or processes beyond the prompt's time frame (up to 100 years before).
- Determine if the context is specific and relevant, rather than vague or unrelated.
- Provide specific examples from the student's response that demonstrate contextualization or lack thereof.
</rubric_analysis>

3. Document Use (0-2 points)
<rubric_analysis>
- First, identify and list ONLY the documents provided in the prompt (1 image + 6 text documents)
- For each document referenced in the student response:
  * Verify it matches one of the provided documents exactly
  * Mark any references to documents not in the prompt as invalid
  * Include a brief description of how the valid document was used
- Count only valid documents that address the topic of the prompt
- Evaluate if at least four valid documents are used to support an argument
- Check for meaningful use of valid documents only (explaining how each supports the argument)
- Document references that cannot be matched to the provided stimuli should be marked as invalid and not counted toward the score
</rubric_analysis>

4. DBQ Outside Evidence (0-1 point)
<rubric_analysis>
- Identify any specific, relevant pieces of historical evidence not found in the documents.
- Verify that the outside evidence is fully accurate (no vague claims).
- Check if it directly supports an argument (not just a side fact).
- Ensure it is not already present in the documents.
- Confirm that the outside evidence is connected to the thesis and not used for contextualization.
- List any specific examples of outside evidence used in the response.
</rubric_analysis>

5. Document Analysis (0-1 point)
<rubric_analysis>
- First, verify that any documents being analyzed are from the provided set of stimuli
- For documents being analyzed with HIPP:
  * Confirm the document exists in the prompt materials
  * If the document referenced isn't from the prompt, mark the analysis as invalid
- Only count HIPP analysis of verified, provided documents
- Ensure at least two valid documents are analyzed using HIPP elements
- Check that the analysis explains how/why the document's sourcing is relevant
- Invalid document analysis (of non-provided documents) should not count toward the point
</rubric_analysis>

6. DBQ Complexity (0-1 point)
<rubric_analysis>
- Evaluate if the response demonstrates a nuanced understanding of the historical development in the prompt.
- Check if it addresses multiple causes and effects, different perspectives, or connections between different time periods.
- Determine if it goes beyond a straightforward response by weaving together different arguments.
- Look for and list specific examples of:
  1. Addressing contradictions or counterarguments within their discussion
  2. Weaving together different arguments rather than listing them separately
  3. Comparing the effects across different regions
</rubric_analysis>

After completing your analysis, provide a final score breakdown using the following format:

<score_breakdown>
Thesis Construction: [0/1]
Contextualization: [0/1]
Document Use: [0/2]
DBQ Outside Evidence: [0/1]
Document Analysis: [0/1]
DBQ Complexity: [0/1]
Total Score: [0/7]
</score_breakdown>

Remember to carefully consider all aspects of the response.
